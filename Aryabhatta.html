            <p style="color: beige;">
                Aryabhata's works, including "Aryabhatiya" and "Arya Siddhanta," cover mathematics and astronomy in detail.<br>
                Aryabhata's achievements range from fundamental mathematical concepts to precise calculations of planetary positions.<br>
                He introduced innovative ideas like writing numbers as alphabets and accurately approximating pi.<br>
                Aryabhata's influence extended globally, with translations of his works and impacts on scholars like Chinese mathematicians.<br>

One of the greatest Indian mathematicians and astronomers in fact the first Indian satellite launched back in 1975 was named after Aryabhata mostly what we know about this great genius is that he invented zero and that's about it and not much that we hear about Aryabhata in the mainstream Indian education well is it just the zero that he has invented no not at all there is a lot more to it and this short documentary is our small attempt to bring forward all the discoveries of Aryabhata beyond zero. <br><br> 

In the next couple of minutes let us understand about Aryabhata his life and works his key contributions and how his influence has been in India and across the world in the field of mathematics and astronomy starting with Aryabhata's life and his works. <br><br> 

<img src="images/Aryabhata/Screenshot (59).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

Back in the fifth century during the reign of Gupta's dynasty one of the golden ages of India the earlier millennium Aryabhata was born in and around Pataliputra or modern-day Patna in Bihar on March 21 year 476 CE he was one of the greatest mathematicians and astronomers of those times and very little is known about his personal life all that we know about Aryabhata is through his works where he documented a lot of mathematical and astronomical details in couple of scriptures. <br><br> 

<img src="images/Aryabhata/Screenshot (60).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

The most important works of Aryabhata is in the name of Aryabhatiya it's a treatise on astronomy astrophysics and mathematics and the second one is Arya Siddhanta which further talks about all the mathematical concepts involved in astronomical calculations Arya Siddhanta is now lost and few phrases of Arya Siddhanta are referred in the subsequent mathematicians and astronomers of seventh and eighth centuries onwards we don't know what exactly was described in Aarya Siddhanta beyond very few details that were quoted by other astronomers in their scriptures the third one is Al-Nanf this also is a lost scripture of Aryabhata and this one is quoted from the west Asians or the Persians is part of their mathematical scriptures of all Aryabhatiya is the only text that is well preserved completely as it is written by Aryabhata 1500 years ago. <br><br> 

<img src="images/Aryabhata/Screenshot (61).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

Astronomy has been a very important field of science that has contributed to the development of mathematics back in ancient India and talking of astronomy Surya Siddhanta a scripture given by lord Surya himself towards the humanity this scripture is the world's oldest treaties available on astronomy till date no historical dating has been ascribed to Surya Siddhanta yet and is considered as prehistoric and this Surya Siddhantha has been the baseline for Aryabhata's work in Aryabhatiya. <br><br> 

<img src="images/Aryabhata/Screenshot (62).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

 India has a very powerful linguistic tradition with Sanskrit a language that is capable of condensing huge amounts of information in very short format and Aryabhata stands as yet another example for that entire Aryabhatiya is just 121 slokas means you can just print them in two or three papers and that's about it but it holds a wealth of information here is what it looks like aryabhatiya internally is divided into four chapters there are Gitika Pada, Ganita Pada kala let us see what they are in detail. <br><br> 

 <img src="images/Aryabhata/Screenshot (63).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

 the first chapter is Gitika Pada the very fundamentals of mathematics are described in this chapter starting from how to write numbers and most importantly this chapter focuses on the units of measurement of time it explains in great detail about how time computation was classified back in ancient India which of course is still in tradition till today then calculations of earth's rotations and rest all mathematical concepts in and around time competition basically these are the fundamentals not the specifics yet. <br><br> 

 <img src="images/Aryabhata/Screenshot (64).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

 The second chapter is Ganita Pada and, in this chapter, Aryabhata talks about the geometrical principles like measurement of area of different geometrical shapes both two-dimensional as well as three-dimensional then he talks about arithmetic progressions which are like calculating the sum of a series or sum of squares of a series so basically different arithmetic progressions which we have learned in our high school and the most important of all indeterminate equations dealing with the unknown quantities your algebra the foundations of it and one of the very important contributions from Aryabhata dealing with indeterminate equations is explained in Ganita pada and many more basically this chapter with its concepts that we just said are the foundations for the next chapters which deals with computing planetary positions their orbits their sizes and their movements. <br><br> 

 <img src="images/Aryabhata/Screenshot (65).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

 up next is the third chapter kala kriya pada as the name suggests this chapter deals with measurement of time how do we put to practice what was explained in chapters 1 and 2 for measurement of time determining the planetary positions determining days of week and many more while reading this chapter one thing was very clear that i could understand he talks about the velocities of planets to be different in different places in their orbits in fact like we mentioned in one of my earlier documentaries on Vedic geometry Aryabhata is the first one to discover the equation of speed is equal to distance by time which is one of the foundational pillars of physics as we know today but not many people are aware of his contributions unfortunately. <br><br>  

 <img src="images/Aryabhata/Screenshot (66).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

let's move on the last one and the fourth chapter is Gola pada and as the name suggests it deals with Bhutal or the earth this chapter contains the trigonometric principles motions of planets observing from earth and the geospatial competitions of time location and a lot more one very important thing to understand here is trigonometry has its roots in astronomy as you might know trigonometry is about calculating the ratios of the sides of a triangle as a function of its angles the reason why this entire science of trigonometry originated is to compute the angles of observation of planets standing on earth and speaking of trigonometry we always hear about the contributions that came in from Greeks but there are much older and certain incredible contributions to trigonometry that came in from India and will briefly go through them as well in this video. <br><br> 

<img src="images/Aryabhata/Screenshot (67).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

 and that's briefly what we saw is about the life and works of Aryabhata and speaking of his contributions now let's quickly see certain key contributions that came in from Aryabhata and we would like to make one point very clear here Aryabhata is a very complex mathematical and astronomical treatise so we just handpicked very few contributions which are easy to understand for everybody all age groups who are watching this video and in this video we are not going to cover the contributions if they are a little more complex for instance dealing with indeterminate equations we did not cover in this video for a simple reason not everyone will be able to understand it and our intention here in this video is to make a simple and lucid documentary about 
 Aryabhata so if you're a physics or a math's geek instead of watching this video i suggest you pick up his book aryabhatiya and start reading it it's pretty easily available online so now let's see what are the key contributions that came in from Aryabhata starting with the first one writing numbers as alphabets let me take a pause here i read comments from couple of people on my documentary about gravity if i have to summarize people were of impression that there were no mathematical formulas that were  contributed from India on these concepts and most of them were left theoretical in nature but that is fundamentally wrong and i repeat it is fundamentally wrong that statement and here is why based on our current knowledge system when you talk about formulas or any empirical representations it is always done with numbers or arithmetic symbols or equations and stuff like that but back then in ancient India all the mathematical concepts or the formulas are written in the format of Sanskrit slokas and this just one contribution of Aryabhata will clear out the misunderstandings what people are having that Indian sciences are more theoretical in nature no that's not and let us see what this contribution is about Aryabhata invented a system of assigning numbers to alphabets kind of an encryption you can say or hashing where you can transpose the numbers into letters or words and sentences so basically instead of writing sequence of numbers or large numbers astronomical figures which maybe runs up to 20 or 30 digits can just be written in two or three words that is the beauty of the system even till today especially in the state of Kerala there is a system called as Katapayadi where the numbers are represented in the format of Malayalam words so basically it looks like Malayalam but actually they are numbers it is called as Katapayadi system and this system invented by Aryabhata is the ancestor for the current katapayadi system in Kerala let us understand how this system of Aryabhata encryption technique works for ease of understanding we'll keep it very simple so basically what he did is he assigned all the vowels with the base 10 that means r is 10 r is 100 e is 1000 e is 10 000 and so on and when it starts from the consonants there are certain values that are assigned by first classifying them under one family and then assigning numbers to that family as you see in the lookup table here and if we would like to transpose a number into alphabets and words all we need to do is replace the numbers with those positions here given for the alphabets from the lookup table if this is sounding a bit difficult to understand let me make it very simple open up any excel sheet and go to the rightmost column it shows as xfd that is the hundred and 16308 fourth column the maximum limit of columns that we have in an excel sheet but is represented as XFD because the columns in excel sheet is a 26 base system so we have a to z and then again from a A A B A C and so on just like how we have in a dictionary so this is an exact example of how Aryabhata system also works it's pretty easy to understand. <br><br>  

<img src="images/Aryabhata/Screenshot (69).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

let us go through this below example just like how xfd even though it looks like alphabets but actually represents a number of 16384 let us take a word Kuchi and see how it actually represents a number now Kuchi two-lettered word and if we further break it down Ku is again ka plus u is Ku and cha plus e is chi so let's start with the first one in the above chart if you see represents one and r is a vowel and as i said the vowels are of base 10 so a is 1 r is 10 e is 100 e is 1000 who is 10 000. so the combination of car plus o will be like placing in the position represented by its vowel so Ku here takes the value of k from the chart above and o represents the 10 000 positions so that's how coup becomes 10 000. in the same way g following the same principle of char plus e from the above chart cha or c represented here as c takes the value of six and a ah e so that's the third one so the third position which is six hundred so Ku plus chi Kuchi is 10 600 this is how a number is represented in the format of a word and you'll see its practical uses as we proceed in this video and this entire technique which we have been explaining since last two minutes is just documented by Aryabhata in two lines in the sloka above <br><br>  

<img src="images/Aryabhata/Screenshot (70).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

and that is why Sanskrit is the most scientific language known to mankind let me clear out the misconception of few people like we mentioned that Indian sciences are not empirical in nature here is an example from Madhava of Sangam Grama grammar he is the first one to invent a method to calculate the value of pi to infinite digits as you know it's a transcendental number it never ends while the world was struggling adding one decimal after the other it was Madhava who has given this formula for pi back in 1200 this entire formula is just represented in two lines of Sanskrit sloka given about it doesn't look like a formula but it is just that we need to improve our competency to read Sanskrit which unfortunately Indians don't have today and until we improve on that aspect understanding the true heritage of India is just impossible. <br><br> 

<img src="images/Aryabhata/Screenshot (71).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

let's get to the second contribution of Aryabhata he is one of the earliest mathematicians in India who gave the value of pi accurate to four digits again coming back to my earlier documentary on Vedic geometry i quoted that the value of pi was not known to Indians and its origins are of Greek or arguably Egyptians but we got a lot of messages that pi was known to Indians much before and the value of pai was actually discovered by Indians honestly i did not find any such references which says that pi is discovered in India before Greeks so if any of you have any concrete correct reliable source of information when we are saying it we are referring to the original scriptures please help me understand and we are happy to correct our statements until then let's go with what Aryabhata gave so what Aryabhata gave the value of pi as is a fraction of two five digit numbers he says that 100 added four multiplied by 8 and added 62 000 and this is the approximate circumference of a circle whose diameter is 20 000 so basically what he means is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter which is pi and the value here ends up with 3.14 most important thing here to notice is he says that this value is approximate and not accurate that's what the translation of the Sanskrit sloka means so it is very clear that Aryabhata is aware of the concept of pi and he very much knows that it's a transcendental number and that is the reason he just gave it has an approximate number and not an accurate one. <br><br> 

<img src="images/Aryabhata/Screenshot (72).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

The third contribution is calculating the area of a circle without using pi so Aryabhata says that half of the circumference when multiplied by half of the diameter that exactly gives the area of the circle again here read the word exactly so he's sure that the product of half of circumference and half of diameter gives an exact value of circle so he's very sure about what his documenting of course and that's why he's one of the greatest mathematicians so this we already covered in my previous documentary on Vedic geometry so we will not spend much time here why this formula came into existence and how this can be seen in conjunction with Sulbha sutras where you measure the circumference of a circle with a rope and then calculate the area using these kind of formulas. <br><br> 

<img src="images/Aryabhata/Screenshot (73).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

up next is another contribution where he classified time in great detail this one you cannot really call as contribution of Aryabhata because this has been the classification of time in puranas or Vedas any Indian scriptures talks about the same classification the topmost unit of measurement of time is called as Kalpa that is one day of brahma revered as the primordial source of creation of the nature and cosmos now his day is taken as the highest unit of measurement of time so one day of brahma or the Kalpa has 14 subunits of time which is called as manvantara so they are Swayambhu manvantara, Swarochisha manvantara, Uttam, Tapasa, Raivata, Chakshush, Vaivasvata, Savarni, Daksha Savarni, Brahma Savarni, Dharma Savarni, Rudra Savarni, Deva Savarni, Indra Savarni so 14 manvantaras make one day of brahma and currently as per Aryabhata we are in Vaiwaswat manvantara.This is actually the way time is computed in India since the beginning of time and if you go to any temple the priest in the temple before starting any kind of a puja will narrate the entire sequence of the time where we are and then start the puja so it has been a practice in India since thousands of years defining the time and place we are in while performing the puja is called as Sankalpa and that's where you can get to hear all the time narration of the sequence and all anyways let's move on [Music] the reason why i pulled up this classification of time is which is actually given in Aryabhatiya, Aryabhata gave his date of birth in a very interesting format he says that three quarters of a current yuga and 60 times the 60 year cycles and 23 years passed since my birth till date so it's a long calculation but to keep it short so that gives us his date of birth as 21st of march 475 CE and the date of writing the aryabhatiya this 21st of march 499 CE and as for Aryabhata the kali yuga it started approximately in 3000 BCE plus or minus 100 or so. So that's basically how the time was computed the reason why we need to focus on these kind of elements is if we look at the documented history as of now it just talks about the Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro civilizations approximately between 3 000 and 1300 BC but we have a lot of historical documents like Sri Ramayana and Mahabharata which happened thousands of years even before that understanding the history of a country is very important because if i don't understand the history of my country in a factual format and someone else from outside will come and narrate the history to me and there is a huge scope for religious or political or whatever motivations which kind of distort history in their interest well Aryan invasion theory is a classic example for that good that nowadays totally shattered. <br><br> 

<img src="images/Aryabhata/Screenshot (74).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

 let's move on another great invention of Aryabhata is the sine function is the first one to identify the r sine differences in terms of arc minutes so it's a bit technical, but we will keep it very short and simple, so you remember the trigonometrical equations that you have learned about the sine theta cos theta and all the how the sine wave goes on or the sine function goes on right you know wave pattern so it has certain metrics to it which if joined gives us a sine wave so here if you read the sloka above it says Makhi Bakhi Dhaki sounds a bit funny but actually these are numbers in the earlier part of this video we saw how the encryption technique of Aryabhata was given right writing the numerical in the format of alphabets that is exactly what is incorporated here Makhi is 225 Bakhi is 224 and so on so looking at this sloka nobody from outside India has a clue about what this is unless one understands the actual ciphering technique given by Aryabhata this is again another classic example of how the scriptures are holding up hidden scientific details and to understand that one should have the competence of Sanskrit and many people are asking me questions about Sanskrit honestly we also don't know about it we are just struggling to understand bits and pieces of Sanskrit translations what i cover in my videos are the translations given by the Sanskrit scholars or the researchers which are published in various research papers and old books and stuff like that and talking of sign function another interesting historical fact is the name sign is of Sanskrit origin the sine function which was discovered in India was initially called with the name jia jar represents a bow a curved bow just like how the half cycle of the sine wave is bent just like a bow so that's where it was initially called as ja in Sanskrit and that was eventually translated by the Persian mathematicians like Al-Khwarizmi and they started calling it as jiba a slightly distorted variant of Jya and this jiba eventually when it was further translated by the European mathematicians they called it as Sinum, Sinum in Latin means a fold or a bend and finally when it came to English it evolved as sign so this is the evolution of jia which is in Sanskrit to sign what we call today in English. <br><br> 

 <img src="images/Aryabhata/Screenshot (75).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

 like this there are 120 slokas given by Aryabhata in aryabhatiya which talks about incredible scientific details about mathematics and astronomy but how can we conclude this video without talking about zero the one which we are all very proud of so here it is he gave a place value system and not really a zero to be very clear and specific so this is what he says and so on and finally as you see here in the box highlighted which is the place value system with a base 10 so basically the concept of place value system is the value of the number is decided by the position in which it sits in a given number that means one is just one but it depends on where we position this one the value of one changes and this is a base 10 system and what the whole world is using today called as the Hindu numerical system is exactly what you're seeing on screen and this is the reason why we regard Aryabhata as the inventor of zero but actually we should be calling it as the place value system and this is one of the best contributions from India towards the field of mathematics and you want to understand the value of this one take two roman numerals and try to multiply or divide them and then you will understand the value of place value system this number system has eased up the arithmetic operations drastically this is the foundation for the mathematics what we know today. <br><br> 

 <img src="images/Aryabhata/Screenshot (76).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

In this context we would like to address one very important perception of people let's talk about eclipses science and superstition a tussle between these is often that we hear as a conversation during eclipses first let's see what Aryabhata explains about eclipses in Aryabhatiya he clearly says the following moon is like water and sun is like fire here his metaphorically representing moon which is cold with water and sun which is hard with fire moon obstructs sun and the shadow of earth obstructs moon causing eclipses this is what the translation of the above sloka from Aryabhatiya but the assays these are the words of Aryabhata himself and this clearly reflects the scientific fact behind the occurrence of eclipses now let's talk the belief around it most of you know the story about how Rahu and Ketu are believed to be swallowing up sun and moon during eclipses and the belief system and how people worship around it now let me take this head on the culture and the ethos of India is fundamentally built around the values of gratitude a deep sense of gratitude towards nature cosmos and everything and this is the reason why we have a lot of manifestations and personifications of gods so eclipse is nothing but a shadow a time specifically whether auspicious or inauspicious put that aside when the planets which is sun and moon as per Hindu cosmology are having significant impact in every day every minute of our lives it is a deep sense of gratitude and devotion that people express and personification of those times the shadow paths is revered as Rahu and Ketu along with the seven other planets so during those times it has been a tradition to follow certain guidelines there need not to be any scientific relevance to it whether you eat during eclipse or you don't eat that does not need to have any scientific relevance it is just a token of gratitude now the problem is twofold one set of people ridicule it and the other set of people observe it the problem with the people who ridicule it are it's a simple common sense that when someone else is believing in something why do you want to go ahead on to it and for the other set of people who are believing in it you believe it because you respect and you devote yourself towards that belief do not seek any western validation or scientific validation in everything what we do a deep sense of gratitude and belief doesn't need any validation from anybody if you believe it with your heart and soul just do it you do not need any validation from anybody else at the same time for people who do not believe in it is a simple common sense that i should not ridicule other person's belief this might sound a bit off topic but the reason i brought this up is to explain that Indians know how the mechanics of eclipse works since thousands of years this is not a superstitious civilization everything here is associated with a deep sense of gratitude devotion and values. <br><br> 

<img src="images/Aryabhata/Screenshot (77).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

 like this Aryabhatiya has a lot of mathematical and astronomical concepts detailed out and like we already mentioned we just picked up the ones which are simple and easy for everybody to understand but there are a lot of mathematical concepts just to briefly touch base on these are all what are explained in Aryabhatiya starting with solving indeterminate equations and then cube roots and square roots areas of geometrical shapes time competitions across earth arithmetic progressions calibrating orbits of planets diameters of planets and its epicycles speed distance time calculations planet obliquity calculations and finally apogee and perigee calculations like this there are a lot many mathematical procedures that were given in Aryabhatiya to calculate the planetary positions and a lot more. <br><br> 

 <img src="images/Aryabhata/Screenshot (78).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

 let's get to the final chapter of influence of Aryabhata in India as well as outside India Aryabhata as a mathematician and has works documented in Aryabhatiya, Arya Siddhanta and more had a profound influence on Indian mathematicians and astronomers like Varaahamihir, Brahmagupta,Bhaskaracharya there are historical records about Chinese travelers especially I-ching in 7th century who studied in the Nalanda university in India picking up the mathematical concepts and translating them into Chinese language Aryabhata's works were translated in Chinese as well coming to the west Asian part there is incredible influence of Aryabhata on many question mathematicians like al-hawazi, al-mashar al-Khwarizmi al-Ashmi al-Biruni al-Sijzi who took inspiration from Aryabhata and developed the mathematical concepts further on their own as well in fact Aryabhata was referred as al-Arjabhar in the Persian texts the translated versions of aryabhatiya no matter which field of science you take it is always a cumulative and collective evolution of people across the world since here we are talking from the perspective of Aryabhata we are bringing out the fact that how Aryabhata's works influenced others the same way there are historical records about how Greek mathematicians influenced Indians so it's all a cultural exchange back then it's not that one civilization invented everything and the rest just simply copied from it it's a kind of a cultural exchange it's a knowledge transfer that happens every civilization has their own inventions and discoveries and that is the reason why the science has evolved to the state where we are currently but unfortunately the history about science that we read today is mostly written in a Eurocentric manner that is because of a residual effect of the colonization having said that there are incredible contributions that came in from Europe needless to say about it but the fact is when you're talking about the history of science the contributions that came in from India are really significant yet we did not hear them anywhere in today's world at least to the extent that it's supposed to for a human intellect to evolve we need both inspiration from history and curiosity from science both put together serves the best combination for the betterment of humanity and as always thanks for reading.
