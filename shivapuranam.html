        Veda Bhumi the land of knowledge this has been one of the names of Bharat and rightfully so. Bharat has an ocean full of knowledge right from Vedas purana smriti Upanishads agama Siddhanta's, the volume of knowledge that we have in Bharat is wide deep and complex Pancha Siddhan tika  - treaties on astronomy, Patanjali yoga shastra- principles of yoga, Charaka Samhita- principles principles on surgery and Medicine, rasendra Mangalam- signs of alchemy, Vaishika darshan- principles of atomic theory, Arya Bhatia principles of astronomy like this the list goes on and on and on.<br><br> 

 

let's get started,<br><br> 

 We know what you might be thinking about the map of Bharat shown here we'll talk about it towards the end of the document. and it is not about what you might be thinking.<br><br> 

Vidyesh Wara Samhita authored 18 Maha purana and out of that 18 Maha puranas Maha puranas Siva Maha Puran this is the topic of interest for us today Siva Puranam is one of the largest Maha purana and internally it has Vindheshwara Samhita, Rudra Samhita, Shata Rudra Samhita, Koti Rudra Samhita, Vaya Viya Samhita six books as we know today together make Siva Maha purana. but there are many other books which are possibly lost, and we don't have the full Siva Puranam as it was many centuries ago. in Seva Maha Puranam of all the six books Uma Samhita written in the name of ma Parvati. this is where in Uma Samhita the ancient human anatomy is detailed out at an astonishing level of granularity. right from the metabolism in human beings up until how the foetus gets developed month by month, and a lot more details about human anatomy are detailed in Uma Samhita. and in this research let's try to understand the astonishing details about human anatomy as described in Siva Maha Puranam by Veda Vyasa Maharshi.<br><br>  

there is quite a deep background and context about Uma Samhita in Siva Puranam but owing to the subject. and the objective of this research let's directly cut across to the point of our interest it all starts with a conversation between Brahmamanasaputra Sanat kumara and Maharishi shri Vedavyasa.<br><br>  

व्यास उवाच | <br><br>

विधिं तत् वदेदानिनं जीव जन्मविधानतः |<br><br> 

गर्भे स्थितिं च तस्यपि वैराग्यर्थं मुनीश्वर || 1 || <br><br>

these are the words of Veda Vyasa Mahashri towards Sanat kumara. o Muniswar to realize the materialistic and worldly Detachment please narrate to me how human beings grow in the womb and the process of their birth. thus, Sanat kumara starts narrating to Veda Vyasa Maharshi about the human anatomy. <br><br>

  

for ease of understanding all the details narrated by Sanat kumara I cut it into three different chapters.<br><br> 

 

metabolism in human beings. <br><br>

all about pregnancy and foetus development.<br><br> 

psychology of the foetus when it was in the mother's womb. <br><br>

 

 

In chapter one let's try and understand how metabolism in human beings is explained and in chapter number two it's all about pregnancy and foetus development and in chapter number three the psychology of the foetus when it was in the mother's womb so these are the three important parts of the entire conversation that essentially explains about human anatomy as described in Siva Maha purana two quick things before we move forward number one the chapters might appear disconnected but it does not you'll get to know the flow once we get through the chapters they're very much connected and relevant to each other and point number two the details about human anatomy in Siva Puranam are really extensive we just cherry-picked few slokas to give you an essence of or rather the broad sense of how human anatomy is described in this ancient scripture so with that let's get started <br><br>

  

Metabolism in Human beings: - <br><br>

 

 मलैर्द्वादशाभिः कित्तं भिन्नं देहद्बहिर्भवेत् | <br><br>

रसस्तु देहे सरति स पुष्ठस्तेन जायते || 6 || <br><br><br><br>

  

कर्णाक्षीनासिक् जिह्वा दंतः शिश्नो गुडं नखाः |<br><br> 

मालाश्रयः कफः स्वेदो विन्मूत्रं द्वादश स्मृतः || 7 ||<br><br><br><br>

  

Chapter 22 Uma Samhita Shiva Puranam <br><br>

 

so, let us get to the first chapter the metabolism in human beings. the translation is the ears, eyes, nose, tongue, teeth, genital, anus, nails, are the receptacles of Mala which is the excrete in a human body. sweat phlegm faces and urine together are the 12 places in the body where excretion happens [1].  and this excretion is a result of the flow of rasa all over the body Rasa here refers to the flow of vital energy all over the body, and excretion in these 12 places is a result of it that's what it means [2].<br><br><br><br> 

 

 

हृतपद्मे प्रतिबद्धश्च सर्वनाद्यस्समनततः | <br><br>

ज्ञेय रसप्रवहिन्यस्तत्प्रकारं ब्रुवे मुने || 8 || <br><br>

Chapter 22 Uma Samhita Shiva Puranam <br><br>

 

when we were discussing about the metabolism in human body it was mentioned that the flow of Rasa is the cause, and the excretion is its effect and in this sloka the rasa is further elaborated. rasa means the vital energy in human body and the channels through which the Rasa flows all over the human body is called as Nadi and this Nadi is not equal to nerves as it's commonly mistaken rather Nadi is a channel for the flow of the vital energy Rasa. in the classification of Nadi is more transversal in nature it essentially cuts through the nervous system, muscular system and the skeletal system in a human body. it's more of a ayurvedic way of looking at human body it is not mentioned here in the sloka but in Ayur-Veda the entire human body has 72 000 Nadis spread all over carrying out vital energy flow to each and every part of the body. and here in this sloka it means all the Nadis present in human body are centrally connected and orchestrated from heart, and from the heart the flow of rasa through the Nadis all over the body are centrally orchestrated from the heart of a human being. now let's connect to the previous one and read it together the flow of rasa is centrally orchestrated from the heart of a human body through the channels which are called as nadis and as a result of this flow of Rasa excretion which is Muller happens in 12 places in human body. so rasa is the vital flow of energy throughout the body orchestrated from the heart and as a result of it the excretion happens but what causes rasa here it is <br><br> <br><br>

 

तसां मुखेषु तं सूक्ष्मं प्राणास्थापयेत रसम | <br><br>
रसेन तेन नादिस्ताः प्राणं पूरयते पुनः || 9 || <br><br>

Chapter 22 Uma Samhita Shiva Puranam <br><br>

 

the translation is which is the inhaled air fills the minute entry points of each Nadi by aiding the flow of rasa all over the body thus Prana is sustained. so basically here the respiration is being explained Prana which is the inhale air supports or augments the flow of Rasa which is the vital source of energy what's important to observe here is Prana or the inhaled air is supporting the flow of Rasa and it is essential to establish the flow of Rasa but it is not the cause for existence of rasa but prana Vayu is a very essential element in the flow of Rasa throughout the Nadis all over that's what it means. <br><br><br><br>

 

पुन: प्रयान्ति सम्पूर्णास्तश्च देहं समाततः | <br><br>

ततस्सा नादिमध्यस्थश्शरीरेणात्मना रसः || 10 || <br><br><br><br>

  

पच्यते पच्यमानच्च भवेत्पाकद्वयं पुन: | <br><br>

त्वक् तय वेष्यते पूर्वं रुधिरं च प्रजायते || 11 || <br><br>

 

Chapter 22 Uma Samhita Shiva Puranam <br><br><br><br>

 

 the rasa which is the vital source of life is created due to two modes of digestion in a human body digestion of the food that we take this digestion process happens in two different modes and this very process is also the source for formation of skin and blood in human beings that is the essence of these two slokas so let's connect it backwards the food that we take gets digested and it causes Rasa and the flow of Rasa is augmented by the flow of prana Vayu to all the Nadis which are centrally connected at the heart and as a result of the flow of the vital energy rasa mala is generated now that's the sequential process of human metabolism being explained in Siva Puranam so like this the metabolism is further detailed out in Siva purana but to cut it short and move forward it further elaborates on the formation of the tissues in our body 
 <br><br><br><br>
 

रक्तलोमनि मासं च केशः स्नायुश्च मान्सतः | <br><br>

स्नायुतश्च तथास्थिनि नखा मजजस्थिसंभवः || 12 || <br><br>

 after explaining the metabolism its effects and all here we get to the point where how the body tissues are formed and this is one of the slokas which explains just that the heat of the body and flesh are produced from the blood the hair on the head and the sinews are produced from the flesh from the sinews the bones are produced the nails and bone marrow are produced from the bones and this creation of body tissues is effect while the metabolic processes Remain the cause. goes on detailing about how different parts of the body are formed the tissues its functions and lot more  
 <br><br><br><br>
 

मज्जाकरणवैकल्यं शुक्रं हि प्रसादात्मकम् | <br><br>

इति द्वादशधान्नस्य परिणामः प्रकीर्तितः || 13 || <br><br>

 

so, moving next on to the most important Point while explaining the formation of different tissues and all there is a point where it starts explaining about the semen the semen is the source for the Genesis of progeny of a human being so now let us see how the life begins and that brings us to the second chapter <br><br> 

 

All about pregnancy and foetus development: - <br><br>

 

and here is what Sanat Kumar narrated to Veda Vyasa Maharshi about pregnancy and foetus development in human beings <br><br>

 

शुक्रोन्नज्जयते शुक्रादिव्यदेहस्य संभवः | <br><br>

ऋतुकाले यदा शुक्रं निर्दोषं योनिसंस्थितम् || 14 || <br><br><br><br>

  

तद्वा तद्वयुसंस्पृष्टं स्त्रीरक्तेनैकतां व्रजेत् | <br><br>

विसर्गकाले शुक्रस्य जीवः कारणसंयुतः || 15 || <br><br><br><br>

 

 these slokas explain the biological Union of a man and woman the Intercourse that leads to conception it says that during the prescribed period post-monthly menstruation in a woman and with the biological Union of man and woman semen enters through the vaginal passage and mingles with the blood of the woman which results in the formation of Jiva and Jiva is life<br><br> 

 from here onwards it gets much more interesting Sanat kumara explains Veda Vyasa Maharshi how the foetus in the mother's womb gets developed month after months<br><br> 

 

पंचरात्रेण कलिलं बुद्बुदाकारतं व्रजेत | <br><br>

बुद्बुदसप्तरात्रेण मानसपेशि भवेत्पुनः || 17 || <br><br>

 and the translation is from the point of the Intercourse of the man and woman after five nights have passed in the fifth night the foetus assumes the shape of a bubble and in the seventh night the foetus becomes a muscular Mass <br><br>

 

 

द्विमासाभ्यन्तरेणैव क्रमाससंभवेदिः | <br><br>

त्रिभिर्मसैः प्रजायन्ते सर्वे ह्यंकुरसन्धयः || 19 || <br><br>

 the second month neck, head, shoulders, backbone, belly, hands, feet, waist and lips are formed and in the third month all the joints in the body are formed  

 

 

मासैश्चतुर्भिरान्गुल्यः प्रजायन्ते यथाक्रमम् | <br><br>

मुखं नासा च कर्णौ मासैः पंचभिरेव च || 20 || <br><br>

 

in the fourth month fingers and Palms are formed and in the fifth month mouth, nose, ears are formed <br><br>

 

दन्तपंक्तिस्तथा गुह्यं जायन्ते च नखाः पुनः | <br><br>

कर्णयोस्तु भवेच्छिद्रं शशान्मासाभ्यन्तरेण तु || 21 || <br><br>

 

 

by the sixth month of the pregnancy rows of teeth the private parts and nails and the orifice of the ears takes shape is by the seventh month of pregnancy the rectum the genitals as per the gender and the navel are formed  <br><br>

 

पयुर्मेहमुपस्थं च नाभिश्चभ्युपजायते | <br><br>

साधयो ये च गत्रेषु मासैर्जयंती सप्तभिः || 22 || <br><br>

 

by the seventh month the foetus is fully developed now it's very much possible that based on our current understanding of foetus development and pregnancy and the biology around it there could be discrepancies or deviations from what is mentioned in Siva purana totally possible but let's understand one thing this ancient scripture which was written some thousands of years ago articulates the foetus development in the pregnancy and the anatomy of human body so well which is 100 scientific and history it is the Deep Antiquity that leaves all of us in a sense of astonishment as to how such level of detail was possible of course you cannot reconcile in a very hard logical manner because this is a conversation between Brahma and Veda Vyasa Maharshi it is very much mystical metaphysical spiritual and scientific as well so let's leave it there  <br><br>

 

And here are some more interesting details about the foetus: <br><br>

 

अंगप्रत्यंगसंपूर्णः परिपक्वस्स तिष्ठति | <br><br>

उदारे मतुराच्चन्नो जरायौ मुनि सत्तम || 23 || <br><br>

 

this one is rather more about the construct of the womb thus fully developed foetus stays in the mother's womb covered by the embryonic skin here the placenta is being talked about the skin inside the womb of the mother the embryonic skin in which the baby is held <br><br> 

 

मतुराहारकौर्येण षड्विधेन रसेन तु | <br><br>

नाभीनालानिबद्धेन वर्धते स दिनेदिन || 24 || <br><br>

 

the child develops day by day by steadily taking in the food of the mother of all Six States through the umbilical cord two interesting things in the sloka the first one the baby in the mother's womb could taste all the tastes what the mother eats the sixth varieties of taste and all this happens through umbilical cord which ties the mother and the baby together through the umbilical cord the baby tastes all the food taken by the mother and the baby gets developed day by day <br><br>

 like this there are a lot more details about the anatomy of the newborn baby like here are a couple of slokas for your reference the bones are 316 number for a newborn there are 500 muscles and there are 35 million hair follicles same way the solid fat in a newborn is 2. 5 tulas and the blood is three Palas all these are different units of measure which might be difficult for us to understand unless one is really in depth into the scriptures to understand what these units of measure are but bottom line is the anatomy of the newborn baby is also very well defined in Siva Maha Puranam and that brings us to the last chapter of this research <br><br>

 

Psychology of the fetus when it was in the mother's womb: - <br><br>

 	the psychological state of the foetus when it was in the mother's womb and in fact this chapter is the core purpose of why Sanat kumara is explaining to Veda Vyasa Maharshi about the foetus development and the human anatomy  <br><br>

imagine how it would be to drop a living person into a Melting Pot of iron imagine the torture that the person undergoes that's exactly how the foetus feels in its mother's womb that's because of the Jathar Agni which is the gastric fire the acidic secretions the stomach of the mother when she feels hungry in that gastric fire the foetus or the baby feels very tormented  
<br><br>
 

मृतश्चः पुनर्जतो जतश्चः पुनर्मृतः | <br><br>

नानायोनिससहस्राणी मया दृष्टानि जायता || 26 || <br><br>

 

the thoughts of the foetus flows like this it speaks to itself I am dead and born many times and in all these birds have seen many types of worms feeling trapped in the mother's womb undergoing extreme torture the foetus starts to introspect itself it speaks to itself that I am born and dead many times and in all these births and deaths I've seen many mothers in my previous lives basically here the Punar Janmashid Dhantam or the karma Siddhanta The Reincarnation which is essentially an important and central part of Sanatana Dharma that is being talked about and according to Siva Maha Puranam the foetus can think introspect and speak to itself 
<br><br>
 

अधुना जातमात्रोऽहं प्राप्तसंस्कार एव च | <br><br>

श्रेयोऽमुना करिष्यामि येन गर्भे न संभवः || 27 || <br><br>

the foetus speaks to itself like this this time when my mother gives me birth and confers me with samskara, samskara means education nourishment refinement so when my mother gives me the samskara I shall strive to live a life that does not have a rebirth again foetus says to itself that as soon as I am released from this womb I will lose my current memory but I will set on a quest to acquire Sivajnanam which is to understand Shiva which is the ultimate and real knowledge and the only means by which I can escape the Eternal cycle of birth and death 
<br><br>
and finally, Sanat kumara concludes saying 
<br><br>
 

इति देहगृहं ह्येतन्नित्यास्यानित्यमात्मनः | <br><br>

अविशुद्धं विशुद्धस्य कर्मबन्धद्विनिर्मितम् || 51 || <br><br>

 

 it is such is the transient Abode the body of the Eternal Soul the body is impure but the soul is eternally pure the body and its birth is generated due to the Past actions of that Soul resulting in the bondage of the pure soul and the impure body the essence of Sanatana Dharma is every action of yours will have an inalienable consequence attached to it all of us are individually responsible for our actions and its consequences the soul is eternal but the body is transient that is why the body is referred as the body is the result of the actions that the soul has performed in his or her previous lifetimes that in her currently means that what you do today will Define your tomorrow and that's where brahmanas Putra Sanat kumara concludes eventually part of Siva Maha Puranam explaining about the anatomy of human body and its ultimate purpose and a lot more  <br><br>
