        The Vedic Heritage of Param Vir Chakra<br><br> 

        <img src="images/paramveer chakra/Screenshot (47).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

param veer chakra India's highest gallantry award presented for exceptional bravery of the armed forces during the combat and this video is all about the story of this precious metal and its connect with the ancient Indian heritage. <br><br>  

<img src="images/paramveer chakra/Screenshot (48).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

according to the official website of the Indian navy the design of this param chakra depicts Indradev's four of those engraved on the four sides of the national emblem of the republic of India and the picture of the Paramveer chakra the original metal what you see here that's where it is, but the question is why Indradev's Vajra. <br><br> 

<img src="images/paramveer chakra/Screenshot (49).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

what's so special with it let's try to understand that one of the greatest rishis or hermit who lived in ancient India in a time before the Rigveda was written Rigveda is the oldest written record in ancient India as Dadhichi maharishi is mentioned in Rigveda itself he lived much before the Rigveda was written and he lived on the banks of the Saraswati river which was dried up four thousand to eight thousand years tentatively from now and this is his story and on a side note Saraswati river has a deep connect with ancient Indian history <br><br>  

<img src="images/paramveer chakra/Screenshot (50).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

but till now we could not find out when exactly this great river dried up there are no conclusive evidences on this but it flourished many thousands of years ago in the area that's depicted here towards the right many of us are familiar with the Samudra Manthan event a tussle between devas and asuras that was depicted in the Indian epics same way another war broke out between the devas and asuras and we are referring to those times as given in the Indian epics <br><br> 

<img src="images/paramveer chakra/Screenshot (51).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

 the war was between and Indra deva and a demon king and a great devotee of Bhagavan Vishnu and there is a background why brutal attacked Indradev it's to avenge his brother's death but all that's going to be a very long story which is less relevant for us so let's start from the battle between Vrutasura and Indradev and in this battle Vrutasura stands invincible as he was super strong and has the blessings of Bhagavan Vishnu himself. <br><br> 

 <img src="images/paramveer chakra/Screenshot (52).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

 Indradev and all the Devangana's seek refuge in Bhagavan Vishnu to help them in defeating Vrutasura but as Vrutasura is an ardent devotee of Bhagavan Vishnu himself he could not kill him and direct Indradev and the Devangana's to seek the help of Dadhichi Maharshi as they would be needing a celestial weapon to defeat Vrutasura and that weapon can be made only out of the bones of Dadhichi Maharshi. <br><br>  

 <img src="images/paramveer chakra/Screenshot (53).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

with that indradev goes to the Dadhichi Maharishi seeks refuge in him and pleads for help and help here is literally that Dadhichi Maharshi must sacrifice his life and donate his bones to Indradev so that he could forge a celestial weapon to fight against Vrutasura. <br><br> 

<img src="images/paramveer chakra/Screenshot (54).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

 In a very surprising manner Dadhichi Maharshi accepts the request as it could help devas and for the betterment of the humanity to kill Vrutasura was creating a lot of pain for the people around the world Dadhichi Maharshi ends his life in a yoga samadhi donating his entire bones to indradev in Bhagavan Viswakarma forges a celestial weapon out of the bones of Dadhichi Maharshi and hands over to indradev and that weapon is nothing but vajra or Vajrayudha which is forged out of the bones of Dadhichi Maharshi equipped with the Vajrayudha Indradev attacks Vrutasura and this time with that powerful celestial weapon the vajra he could defeat Vrutasura and restore peace in humanity. <br><br> 

 <img src="images/paramveer chakra/Screenshot (55).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

 this is the story of Dadhichi Maharshi as explained in Rigveda and other puranas of the Indian history the shape and the specifics of this weapon the vajra is well explained in the ancient Indian epics but in a more simple manner where can we see this here it is in the metropolitan museum of art in New York USA here is the indradev's statue a 9th century statue made of bronze found in Sri Lanka currently under display in the museum in New York that's the statue of indradev towards the left you can see the Indradev with the elephant which is his vehicle and towards the right is holding the vajra it kind of looks like trident but it's actually a mace with a split club head as it's shown here this is one of the oldest statues of indradev it's almost like 1200 to 1300 years old where we can clearly see how the Vajrayudha was carved based on the depictions given in ancient Indian epics. <br><br> 

 <img src="images/paramveer chakra/Screenshot (56).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

 that's a quick side by side view of the param veer chakra and the indradev's vajra so now you understand why the symbol is carved in param veer chakra it is to represent the Dadhichi Maharshi's supreme sacrifice where he gave up his own life to protect the humanity same way the great martyrs in Indian army navy and air force all the defense forces who put forward their life on the line of fire in protecting Bharat we celebrate the supreme sacrifice of the Dadhichi Maharshi till today and for many centuries to come in the form of Paramveer chakra the highest military award of the republic of India. <br><br> 

 <img src="images/paramveer chakra/Screenshot (57).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

 In our opinion all the param veer chakra recipients and each and every soldier including the police and law enforcement agencies men and women who lost their lives protecting this country has the legacy of Maharshi Dadhichi sacrificing your life to protect the people of your country that's absolutely not a small thing that's the most supreme sacrifice ever and we bow down to all such men and women who laid their lives protecting Bharat. Jai Hind and as always thanks for reading.
