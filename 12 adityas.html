why is Sunday a holiday well that sounds like a stupid question because why not we all love to take a break but still let us ask this question a bit more technically why Sunday is a holiday well the reason is historical and religious in the ancient Jewish tradition given down by Moses. -<br><br> 

<img src="images/12 suns/Screenshot (21).png" style="height: 380px;"><br><br> 

 as part of the Ten Commandments one of the 10 is to keep the day of the Lord holy which means that one day nobody should be working and pray to their God in the Jewish tradition this one day of the 

week is called a Sabbat and this one day break per week is later adopted into Christianity and Islam as well so basically that one day break in a week has historical and religious connotations it is basically grounded in the Abrahamic philosophy and then with the colonization the British and the European imperialistic powers they impose this weekend around the world for cultures who are not necessarily connected with Abrahamic philosophy well at least one good thing of all they imposed is one day break in a week so that's a quick fun fact about why Sunday is a holiday. -<br><br> 

<img src="images/12 suns/Screenshot (22).png" style="height: 380px;"><br><br> 

 another question why 12 months are there just a year there are many calendars over thousands of years being followed around the world <br><br> 

Hindu calendar <br><br> 

Cherokee calendar <br><br> 

Roman calendar <br><br> 

Celtic calendar <br><br> 

Greek calendar <br><br> 

Arabic calendar <br><br> 

Scythian calendar <br><br> 

and there are many civilizations which followed this 12 month approach to divide a year but where are its origins of all the calendars around the world the one being followed in Bharat which is the Hindu calendar technically there is no such name as that but if I really have to give it a name according to Bhartia Jyotisha shastra it holds the undeniable and incontrovertible aspects which give us the full account of why an ear has been divided into 12 months let's try to understand that context to further unfold this article in the name of Jyotisha shastra precisely in terms of luck prediction or future prediction this entire Jyotisha shastra is made a joke by many Jokers let me get this simple and straight Jyotisha shastra is an incredibly fantastic part of the Vedic knowledge system it has very restricted purposes and of all the vangas Jyotish shastra is revered as the eyes of the entire Vedic knowledge system which means of all your sense organs eyes are the most important ones and that is what Jyotisha shastra is appropriated with that is the highest level of reverence Jyotisha shastra holds in the Vedic knowledge systems now that has been nearly reduced about when you are going to win your next Lottery it's a shame on us and we have another set of people who proudly call themselves atheists and rationalists but this is another set of jokers who don't know anything about Jyotish shastra but just pass 

stupid comments about it so let us leave these Jokers to fight amongst themselves let us try to understand in simple words what is Jyotish shastra if you are a school or college going student listen very carefully for EG. take a typical analog clock that has three hands the hours hand minutes hand and the seconds hand how do we read time suppose it is 10 hours 8 minutes and 15 seconds each of the three hands of this clock point to a specific point on the perimeter of this clock which essentially translates into a specific second minute or an hour and the culmination of all these three essentially gives us what is the time. <br><br> 

<img src="images/12 suns/Screenshot (23).png" style="height: 380px;"><br><br> 

 now let us take our little blue planet Earth around the earth there are 12 constellations nothing but clusters of very bright stars these constellations are outside the solar system so naturally sun is much closer to Earth than the constellations and when we observe from Earth we could see sun in the backdrop of one of these 12 constellations now think of an imaginary line just like an hour hand or a minutes hand extending from Earth to Sun just like how we read time in a clock with the revolution of the sun when you observe from Earth it appears that the sun is moving in the backdrop of each of these 12 constellations which takes exactly 30 days or rather approximately 30 days to pass through each constellation the 12 constellations hence the 12 months in an year now same way imagine Moon as another hand of the clock same story repeats Moon traverses 

 

through each of the backdrops of the constellation and there is another way of computing time with taking Moon as your reference point same way Jupiter also now these three are the most important ways or means through which time is computed according to Bhartiya Jyotish shastra calculating the positions of the celestial bodies precisely to the minute to the hour to the second is what Jyotish shastra is all about and for God's sake it is not about when you're going to win your next freaking Lottery your Trigonometry algebra 

 

geometry dealing with unknown quantities quadratic equations most importantly calculus a lot more is originated from bat because of this need to calculate the positions of the celestial bodies why because it also has a very deep spiritual connect and let's not go into that space the ancient time competition mechanisms of Bhartia Jyotisha shastra is far more advanced even today than the modern day ways of time competition it is unimagined ably sophisticated let me give you a simple example and you'll get 

to know that Pushkar how are they calculated Jupiter takes 12 years to complete one revolution around the Sun and according to the Jupiter position in accordance with the sun and moon position that is how the kumbha or the Pushkara are decided which comes once in 12 years let me give you even simpler example to understand what I'm trying to say according to Modern scientific time competition our reference point is just the sun of course the obliquity of the earth and then the rotations of the earth revolutions all these end of the 

 

day hook up centrally only with the Sun but in Jyotisha shastra the time computation is depending on the positions of seven celestial bodies and the relative positions with respect to Earth now that we get a high level understanding of why 12 months in an year now let us try to understand the Bhartiya perspective about this little ball of fire the sun. <br><br> 

<img src="images/12 suns/Screenshot (24).png" style="height: 380px;"><br><br> 

 going to the 12 positions of sun in the backdrops of each of the 12 constellations these 12 positions of sun have highest level of reverence in Bharat is Dwadash Aditya 

 

dwadasa means 12 Dwadash Aditya and since thousands of years in Bharat dwadash Aditya holds highest level of reverence so much so that it is ingrained into the life culture Heritage and everything about Bharat unfortunately the youngsters today in Bharat might not even heard of Dwadash Aditya. <br><br> 

<img src="images/12 suns/12 adityas.jpg" style="height: 380px;"><br><br> 

 hence in this Article Let us delve deep into it in the next couple of minutes the first of the 12 Aditya's is that when sun comes in the backdrop of the constellation Aries during the march to April period Aditya is revered as Dhata and 

 

the depictions of Aditya that you're seeing on the right side of the screen are exactly as per Vishwakarma shastra so the imagery has a deep significance for each of the 12 Aditya that we going to see then comes the second Aditya Aryama when son is in the backdrop of the constellation Taurus during the April and May period this form of Aditya is revered as Aryama and then comes the third Aditya Mitra when sun comes in the backdrop of the constellation Gemini Aditya is revered as Mitra and this happens in <br><br>  


The time period of May to June a quick side note this form of Aditya as Mitra is revered and worshiped across Europe around 2,000 years ago maybe that's a topic for another day but for now let's move on the fourth Aditya is Varuna that's when sun is in the backdrop of the constellation cancer during the time period June to July the fifth Aditya is revered as Indra that's when sun is in the backdrop of the constellation Leo and this happens in the time period of July to August then comes the sixth Aditya 

 

revered as Vivaswan when sun is in the backdrop of the constellation Virgo and this happens in the time period of August to September and then the seventh Aditya revered as Tvashtha when sun is in the backdrop of the constellation Libra and this happens in September to October time period up next is the eighth Aditya revered as Vishnu and this is when sun comes in the backdrop of the constellation Scorpio and this happens s in October to November time period ninth Aditya of the 12 is revered as Anshuman and this is when sun is in the 

 

backdrop of constellation Sagittarius in the time period this phenomenon occurs is November to December the 10th Aditya is revered as Bhaga and this is when sun comes in the backdrop of the constellation Capricorn and this happens during the time period of December to January and this is quite familiar to all of us because Capricorn is called as Makara Rashi and this is when we celebrate Makara Sankranti the process of sun entering the constellation of Capricorn what's so special about this specific constellation this is when the winter 

 

solstices ends and Earth starts moving closer to Sun and that's when your spring season would start so naturally this astronomical phenomenon has an incredible impact on the Agriculture and so is the reason to celebrate makaras ranti in fact every constellation has a Sankranti it is the process of sun entering a specific constellation is revealed as Sankranti but Makara Sankranti is special for the reason that I just mentioned the 11th Aditya is revered as Poosha and this is when sun is in the backdrop of constellation aquaris and 

 

the time period that this phenomenon occurs is January to February and the 12th Aditya is revered as Parjanya and this is when sun is in the backdrop of the constellation Pisces and this phenomenon happens during February to March time period so that's very quickly about the 12 Aditya you take any Scripture of Bharat there is high probability that almost every scriptures you take the Vedas and puranas Itihasas Siddhanta's agamas no matter what there is always a reference made to one of these Dwadash Aditya.  

<img src="images/12 suns/Screenshot (25).png" style="height: 380px;"><br><br> 

instances about Dwadash Adityas starting with the oldest of all the references the rig Veda look in general the Vedas are not straightforward they are quite cryptic to understand nonetheless let's give it a shot Rig Veda first mandala 164.48 that is the precise reference 12 are the points and the wheel is single this essential translates to the 12 constellational positions of sun around the earth and then it goes on explaining about why we had 360 days in the Rig Vedic times the days are counted as 360 why what how when maybe not relevant for the 

current context let's focus only on dwadash Aditya but this is one of the oldest references about Dwadash Aditya a more clear reference about dwadash Aditya emerges from the eighth mandala of Ramayana as you can see here May the Aditya's Savita, Bhaga, Varuna, Mitra bestow upon us the prosperity we plead for some of the Dwadash are quoted in this Shlok: <br><br>  

<img src="images/12 suns/Screenshot (26).png" style="height: 380px;"><br><br> 

like this if we search the entirety of Ramayana Dwadash Aditya are mentioned in innumerable places and many hymns were dedicated in the praise and worship of the 12 constellational positions of the sun revered as dwadasha Adityas then coming to one more very reliable source .the SRI Ramayana itself and these slokas from the Yudh kandam precisely quote the dwadash Aditya at Great length and these are the words of Agastya Maharishi narrating as part of Sri Ramayana to Bhagwan Sri Rama as you can see the 12 names of are encoded into ad as part of Sri Ramayana again another oldest reference quoting dwadash Aditya.<br><br>

<img src="images/12 suns/Screenshot (27).png" style="height: 380px;"><br><br> 

 now let us turn to the scientific scriptures of Bharat like the Surya Siddhanta this reference clearly mentions that the sun remains in each constellation for 1 month 12 such months make a year a direct answer to the question question of why we have 12 months in an year and Surya Siddhanta is one of the oldest astronomical and mathematical treaties known to mankind and this is a handwritten manuscript of Surya Siddhanta couple of centuries old depicting clearly <br><br>  

 <img src="images/12 suns/Screenshot (28).png" style="height: 380px;"><br><br> 

how the 24 hours per day is calculated and what is the rationale behind it. it is an extension to the time computation per month and then in the next level per day as per Surya Siddhant and is an Extinction because 24 hours in a day what you are seeing on the screen is the answer for that in fact the English word hour is a directly loaned word from Sanskrit Hora. Hora is one of the 24 equal parts of a day that Hora eventually got translated or rather transformed into the English word hour and this is what we always say in this website in all of our articles not all great things in this world are invented by Bharat but all the great things invented or discovered by Bharat are not known to the world and top of that list is the astronomical and mathematical contributions that came from Bharat hence all our effort in making this article. <br><br> 

<img src="images/12 suns/Screenshot (29).png" style="height: 380px;"><br><br> 

 let us turn to the physical manifestations of dwadasa across Bharat there are innumerable temples where you can find the manifestations of Surya in different forms of Dwadash Aditya but all 12 at one place over thousands of years in Kashi has been a tradition to worship each of this constellational position of Aditya is dadas Aditya in 12 places in Varanasi what you're seeing on screen are these dwadash Aditya some of them are quite difficult to find in the Cozy streets of Varanasi but nonetheless here are all the 12 Aditya in Varanasi. <br><br> 

 <img src="images/12 suns/Screenshot (30).png" style="height: 380px;"><br><br> 

 now let us turn to the physiological aspects of dwadash Aditya as part of yoga many of us are quite familiar with the Surya Namaskaram Surya Namaskaram has 12 positions as many of us would know each of these positions is a namaskar towards that specific constellational position of t hence 12 different positions as part of Patanjali yoga shastra each of the position of the Surya Namaskaram also has a Mantram associated with the constellational position of each of the Aditya and today the whole world is embracing suya namaskaram that is directly paying respect to the dwadash Aditya knowingly or unknowingly and those who say yoga is secular I'm sorry you are ignorant so let's not try to secularize yoga for God's sake keep the truth the way it is whether you like it or not. <br><br> 

 <img src="images/12 suns/Screenshot (31).png" style="height: 380px;"><br><br> 

 now coming to the spiritual side of Bhartia Samskriti sandhya Vandana is an integral part or rather an integral essential part of day-to-day activities of human 

 

life now let me take the bull by its horns the word Sandya Vandana immediately triggers that okay this is some kind of a Brahmanical practice that is absolutely wrong Sandhya Vandana is meant for all the people men and women of all varnas just that the way you perform sandhya Vandana is different that's a huge Topic in its own right but for the moment let us again stick to the specific concept of dwadash Aditya the essence of Sandhya Vandana is praying to Surya to Enlighten our intellect our buddhi so that as human beings we can use the most powerful 

 

instrument our buddhi for the betterment of society this is what Sandhya VanDam is all about and this Sandhya Vandana is intended to be performed three times a day Sunrise midday and sunset it's tightly coupled with Aditya so to sum it up all dwadash Adias are ingrained into the culture and civilization of Bharata over thousands of years starting with the oldest references the ram SRI Ramayana and many other ancient scriptures which reveal the 12 positions of and then we have the astronomical text like Surya Siddhant Brihad Samhita Etc <br><br> 

which talk about the mathematical calculations behind calculating the length of a day month so on and so forth everything depending on the position of son or Aditya and then we have the physical manifestations of dadas Aditya across the temples like we saw in Varanasi and many other places across bat and then we have the physiological aspect of dwadash Aditya reflecting in the yoga through Sury namaskaram and many other asanas and kriyas in yoga and the legacy of Aditya in Bharat continues with even naming the recent solar probe of ISRO as Aditya L1 

so what I'm trying to say is the legacy of Aditya in Bharat is far more wide deep and complex and it's enormous if we start discovering the significance of dwadasa in Bhartiya Samskriti maybe I missed out on the name of Aditya metaphysically Aditya is revered as the son of Aditi and Kashyapa Prajapati hence the name Aditya let me take a quick side step it's quite essential Satya people just Loosely use these words sat truth alone triumphs we should always speak truth this that and all let me show you a glaring example of what Satya would <br><br> 

<img src="images/12 suns/Screenshot (32).png" style="height: 380px;"><br><br> 

 

look like during the Islamic invasions of Kashmir some religious lunatic who's against this crude ideology of people should not worship idols destroyed and desecrated this Grand Temple of Martand dedicated to Aditya located in Kashmir this happened more than a thousand years ago but still so this person who tried to desecrate and destroy the legacy of Aditya in Bharat by destroying this Grand Temple could not achieve anything because till today the legacy of Aditya lives on and on and on no matter how hard you try to suppress the truth you 

 

cannot deny the fact that every minute every second of Our Lives on planet Earth are directly impacted by sun which essentially translates to the constellational positions through which the seasons happen and everything associated with that hence we revere Dwadash Aditya even though some insecure religious lunatics try to destroy or suppress the truth can never be suppressed and today proudly we all have the solar probe L1 named after Aditya up there in the sky this is a classic example of Satya no matter how much you 

 

try to destroy the truth truth always triumphs and your religious insecurities are stripped naked and people can understand it clearly so sat the gravity of those words is quite heavy so that's a very brief and quick Outlook about Dwadash Aditya and the position the reverence that Surya has in Bhartiya Samskriti we did not even scratch the surface the topic about Aditya as I said is wide deep and complex nonetheless this short documentary is intended to bring in little awareness about what is the significance of dwadash Aditya in 

 

multiple facets of Bhartia Samskriti and we from Bharat would intend to dive deep into each of the facets bringing more content about Aditya and as always thanks for reading.
