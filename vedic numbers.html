        The Secret of Vedic Numbers<br><br> 

<img src="images/vedic numbers/Screenshot (34).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

not all the great things in this world are accomplished by Bharat but definitely all the great contributions from Bharat are not known to the world and that's exactly what we bring forward the authentic stories about Bharat's history which are deeply researched and factual don't take it for my word but do your own research there is one field one specific field in which no other civilization on the face of Earth has contributed as much as Bharat did that is in the field of mathematics and today we are going to talk about an interesting topic that is the numbers the oldest or rather the ancient references of the numbers how were numbers used in Vedas  

 

going to the title of this video The Secret Vedic numbers it is secret because first a vast majority of us don't know it and secondly even though we read it it is very difficult or rather cryptic that we cannot understand what's the rationale behind the usage of those numbers in those places 

 

 so, let's get started the secret Vedic numbers <br><br> 

 <img src="images/vedic numbers/Screenshot (35).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

we picked up five references of the usage of this ancient numbers from The Vedas puranas and itihasas all of them <br><br> 

 

 

<img src="images/vedic numbers/Screenshot (41).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

starting with the first one from Yajurveda Sri Rudram <br><br> 

 the translation of this shlokas is twofold it's all about praying to Rudra or Lord Mahadev seeking His blessings for two number series the first series goes like one three five seven nine eleven thirteen fifteen and so on till 33 and another set of numbers 4 8 12 16 20 24 all the way till 48. For prosperity and happiness this is very cryptic because you can ask for prosperity and happiness by asking for good food good shelter and stuff like that but here the translation literally means please bless us with these numbers so that we can live with happiness and prosperity now what does it mean it is very cryptic until now when we try to search for the meaning of these people have given the their own interpretations of these series it's about a single question as to how these numbers will lead to prosperity and happiness that question is not answered by anyone you can try it for yourself this is the most cryptic series of Sri Rudram in Yajur Vedam rather the ancient or rather the most ancient usage of numbers in a series format over thousands of years we don't even have the definition of even numbers or odd numbers mathematically established by then but in Bharat we have been using this series even today you go to a Shivalay during the Abhisheka the SRI Rudram would be chanted you can check with the acharya in the temple what is the meaning of these numbers and I wish you find a satisfactory answer unfortunately we could not find. the second reference comes from Shukla Yajur Vedam in the worship of Agni here the numbers are used in a different manner <br><br> 

 <img src="images/vedic numbers/Screenshot (42).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

 the translation of this shloka is O Agni May the bricks of this yagna 1 10 10 10s 100 10 hundreds a thousand ten thousand it goes on all the way till a billion grant us prosperity the numbers here are used in the powers of ten again very ancient usage of numbers in the powers of 10. putting aside the spiritual context of this yagna and this dhyana slokas one thing what we can understand is the usage of numbers in Bharat is more ancient than what we could possibly imagine Point number one and point number two nobody in their right sense would Define a number if does not have any practical purpose and here in shukl Yajur Vedam part of this dhyana slokas towards Agni we can clearly see that the numbers were defined till a billion and little over a billion as well we are talking of the times where calculations have to be done manually and still people Define such huge numbers given them a specific name and use them in these Dhyan shlokas  so we should think about what was the purpose of these huge numbers practically Beyond the spiritual context and that's the reason I said the usage of the numbers in Vedas is quite cryptic and secretive that should not give you way to all the kinds of wild imaginations I would say but at the very least we cannot ignore we need to understand as a student's studying stems objects at least we should give them a thought as to why such numbers are used in first place over thousands of years in Bharat <br><br> 

 <img src="images/vedic numbers/Screenshot (38).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

there are innumerable instances of the usage of numbers in Vedas in a very cryptic and secretive format but for now let's switch to itihasas from Sri Ramayana the third reference now how many of us know that there is a number system defined in Sri Ramayana itself let's try and understand in Sri Ramayana written by Valmiki Maharshi in the Yudha Kandam under 28th Circle that is where the construction of Sri Rama Setu was described and in this circle Valmiki Mahashri defined a number system for quantification and articulation of the entire Vanarasena of Bhagwan Sriram, Valmiki Maharshi defined this number system as in a powers of 10 and this is the huge set of slokas so we'll just see the translation of it for any of you who are interested we gave you the exact references <br><br> 

<img src="images/vedic numbers/Screenshot (46).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

so let's see the translation the translation is the first basic unit is taken as Koti one Koti is just one basic unit and do not confuse Koti with crore it does not grow in some sutra one Koti could be just one singular unit so one Koti and then one lakh Kotis is one shanku and then one lakh shankus is one Maha shanku and here on it goes in the multiples of one lakh every time from shanku to mahashanku to vrindam Maha vrindam Padma mahapadma kharvam Maha kharvam samudram and Ogha and Mahaugha these are the numbers defined by Valmiki Maharshi in Sri Ramayana while explaining the count of vanarasena now again not getting into the spiritual context or any other aspect just looking at it from a mathematical standpoint such a huge numbers were in use in Bharat during the times of Sri Ramayana I can keep on going but you get the point so let's move on  

 

 

moving to number four from the grand epic of Mahabharata here again for the quantification of the armies' certain large numbers were precisely defined and the largest unit of an army is called as akshayohini which comprises of four types of forces <br><br> 

Nara -foot soldiers <br><br> 

Ashwa- Horsemen <br><br> 

Radha -Chariot <br><br> 

Gamti -elephants <br><br> 

 

<img src="images/vedic numbers/Screenshot (43).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

in the usage of number of each of them is in a specific ratio of one is to one is to three to five if you read through Mahabharata, you'll understand how the quantification of both sides of the army was done we just gave the numbers here 

 but in Mahabharata as well you have very ancient usage of large numbers <br><br> 

 <img src="images/vedic numbers/Screenshot (39).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

 

 

 moving to the fifth example we have enormous lineup of Siddhanta's thousands of them and from them one such is Sushruta Samhita which is a Doctrine on medicine written by Sushruta Maharshi and here in this there are six tastes what a human tongue could possibly identify sweet sour salty pungent bitter astringent this is as defined in social media and these six days mix among themselves to yield different kind of experiences to a person rather a patient in this context which is defined as 26 – 1 that is equal to 63. now this is the oldest usage of powers of two known to mankind how and why if you ask we challenge you to find it for yourself is there any other older reference than this which is using the powers of two again just a quite a cryptic view of how a two power six minus 1 is equal to 63 but it does not define mathematically or rather empirically because that's not the purpose of this text in first place but however coming back to the cryptic usage of numbers <br><br> 

 

 <img src="images/vedic numbers/Screenshot (44).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

let’s conclude all the document with an example here is a map of how Panchatantra got translated from Bharat through the Middle East towards Europe over many centuries now Panchatantra has been indigenous to Bharat authored by Vidyapati in Bharat while over thousands of years but the knowledge got promulgated from Bharat towards Europe through the Middle Eastern countries this is exactly how the mathematics and particularly in our context the Hindu number system was also promulgated from Bharat via the Middle Eastern countries to Europe and from there through colonization to the whole world that's how the Hindu number system got spread across the world and the number system that we are using today the roots of it lies in the scriptures like Shukla Yajur Vedam Ramayana Mahabharata and it could be even further than that but definitely there are many ancient references lying in front of our eyes in Bharat hidden in the Vedas and here are the people who promulgated the knowledge of Hindu numerals from Bharat to the Middle Eastern countries and there to Europe and the rest of the world <br><br> 

<img src="images/vedic numbers/Screenshot (45).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 30px;"> <br><br> 

to conclude that is a very quick overview about how ancient the usage of numbers in Bharat and not just ancient more than that cryptic and domestic as well needless to say scientific too we'll be coming up with more such stories about the greatness of Bharat and her contributions to the world and as always thanks for reading.
