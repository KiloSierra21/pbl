Just take a look at this map of ancient Bharat all these have been the locations of universities and educational hubs in Bharat for well over thousands of years and as the sloka from the Vishnu purana says the country that lies north of the ocean and south of the Himalayas is called as Bharata the people living in this part of the land are the children of Bharati the literal meaning of the word Bharati means the one who carries knowledge if ancient India was thriving with scores of universities in different fields of education why is that we don't have any significant inventions in the field of science and technology that came in from Bharat over the last 2 000 years or so this is a very pertinent fundamental and a very genuine question let's try and find an answer to it in a very unbiased manner to know nothing but truth.<br><br> 

<img src="images/Bhartiya_Ganitam_1/Screenshot (83).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  


 let's get started cutting across straight to the point what led to the downfall of this great and grand education system in Bharat four main reasons number one pseudo-Brahminical hostility in education we'll get to that in a short while reason number two Islamic invasions of Bharat and the destruction of the universities and the education system here reason number three is the imposition of the English education system by the British the reason number four is pseudo-secularism and the political agenda which failed to revive what the destruction that has happened because of the one two and three reasons and this fourth reason is something that you and me are currently responsible for if you want to know about reasons two and three how Islamic invasions and European colonization destroyed the ancient Indian education system just read about Bakhtiyar Khilji and Thomas Macaulay these two men significantly destroyed the ancient Indian education system shifting our focus from what outsiders did to this country let's try to introspect what we did to our own country so we are going to focus on one and four number one pseudo-Brahminical hostility in education see the fact of the matter is cause-based operation is a very grim reality today so let us not shy away from it and having said that not demonizing any specific community here if you can effort some patience and common sense then listen carefully what we are about to say. <br><br> 

 <img src="images/Bhartiya_Ganitam_1/Screenshot (84).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  


 choice of words is extremely crucial, and w said pseudo Brahminical hostility in education it means a very hostile environment that has been created by pseudo-Brahmins who are pseudo brahmins before we get to that let's try and understand who is brahman in first place, the one who understands the supreme reality or the brahman or the Ishwara is called as brahmana let me make it very simple for each and every one of you to understand take a look at these slokas these are the slokas from Vasistha Dhanur Veda the Samhita which is an ancient scripture about weapons in warfare Dhanur Veda ascribes to Yajurveda and this specific scripture on Dhanur Vedam is written by Vasistha Maharshi who is the guru of Bhagavan Sriram let me read this slokas for you should be taught only to a brahman and who is a brahman that person who is not a miser who's not having any crooked attitude or who is not a dull-headed person but the one who is not having a sense of gratitude these are the bad qualities in a person and if one does not have any of these bad qualities then that person is deemed to be called as a brahmana and only to such kind of a person a guru should teach these are the words of Vasistha Maharshi guru of Bhagavan Sriram so brahmana is more of a classification depending on the qualities of a person fair enough but what about the rest of the society can't they fight can't they learn any of this Dhanur Veda can they learn how to use any of the weapons in ancient Bharat not everyone might have these great qualities of a person which qualifies him or her to be called as a brahmana so what about the rest Vasishtha Maharshi explains it in the immediate sloka here itself is should learn archery to learn how to fight with bow and arrows kshatriya should learn how to fight with a sword a Vaishya should learn how to fight with a spear and a Shudra should learn how to fight with a mace all these are part of Dhanur Veda which is the ancient scripture on weapons and warfare here if you just observe these weapons bow and arrow sword spear and mace a person with highest psychological strength is given the most destructive weapon that has bound arrows and as it comes down to Sudra doesn't mean by birth rather a person with relatively low psychological strength is given a weapon of lesser destruction which is a maze now why are we emphasizing on these shlokas these stand as an example of how this chartered verna system has always been based on the qualities of a person and the profession or occupation of the person but never by the virtue of the birth of that person if varna of a person is by the virtue of the birth of that person then Srirama is a Kshatriya then he should know only about how to fight with a sword but Vashishta Maharshi and Vishwamitra Maharshi taught him how to use bow and arrows because he possesses the qualities of a brahmana as mentioned here so it is not by the virtue of the birth but the qualities of a person <br><br> 

 <img src="images/Bhartiya_Ganitam_1/Screenshot (86).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  


 and those are not our words but the words of Bhagavan Sri Krishna from Bhagavad-Gita “Varnam maya srustam Guna karmavi bhagasha” the four categories of the people Chathur Varnam were created by me according to the people's qualities and activities this is what Bhagavad-Gita says and the reason that we are quoting these slokas from Dhanur Vedam or Bhagavad-Gita and there are tons of others the main reason is all these ancient scriptures which are sacrosanct unequivocally establishes that Chatur varna system is not based by birth of a person but based on the qualities of a person brahman the one who knows the ultimate reality is called as brahmana and the one with very noble qualities but unfortunately this definition of brahmana slowly got transformed not broadly but in specific pockets across Bharat which created a hostile environment in education system keeping away the masses from this great and grand education system in ancient one needs strong devotion and dedication but not birth and cost certificate to acquire knowledge and wisdom this has always been the culture of Bharat and these are not my words again that is the reason we call a student Vidyarthi the one who begs for knowledge so that's about point number one which contributed to the downfall of ancient Indian education system and now let's move on to point number four which is something that you and me are responsible for and by the way two and three we are not going to cover in this video you do your own research and you draw your conclusions and opinions. <br><br>  

 <img src="images/Bhartiya_Ganitam_1/Screenshot (87).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  


let's get to the topic of this video Ganita shastra in the mindset that we need to understand Ganita sastra so what is Ganita in first place let's consider this word Ganapathi it's of two Gana plus Pati gunner means a group or a counting or group of a people and all these different connotations that will be used the word Gana and Pati means leader so the one who is the leader of all the shiva Ganas is revered as Ganapati drawing from the same sense of Ganapati, Ganita means counting and Ganita sastra is a field of study that deals with counting aka mathematics there are other words in Hindi we use Gana Tantra for republic day or Jana ganana for census we did not use those words to explain Ganita sastra the meaning of it but we intentionally use this word Ganapati to explain the definition of Ganita sastra because exactly this is where the problem is in Bharat the ancient Indian education system has been very tightly coupled with the spiritual and philosophical facets of the society and today in the name of secularism or pseudo secularism whichever way that you would like to call it as and in the name of minority appeasement this great grand education system which is tightly coupled with the spiritual and the philosophical facets of human life are being brushed under the carpet because we need to make all religions feel comfortable we mean that's absolute stupidity all religions should be treated equal in the eyes of law and that's it that's about it just because the ancient Indian education system is very tightly coupled with Sanatana dharma not bringing it to forefront is absolute gross stupidity. <br><br> 

<img src="images/Bhartiya_Ganitam_1/Screenshot (88).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

 The roots of Ganita sastra originate from Jyotisha which is an integral part of the Vedic education system the word Jyotisha as and when you hear it immediately what gets to your mind is pseudoscience or superstitions this is exactly the problem that you and me have today our mindset is the first thing that we need to deal with we are very sure that 95 percent of us don't know what is Jyotisha and we jump to a conclusion saying that it's all about superstitions and future prediction and whatnot if one strives to understand and learn the Bhartiya Ganita sastra or the ancient Indian mathematics <br><br> 

 <img src="images/Bhartiya_Ganitam_1/Screenshot (89).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

 then the roots of it lies in Jyotish astra and without knowing a thing about Jyotish shastra if anyone says that Jyotisha shastra is all about pseudoscience and superstition then that person is the biggest idiot on this planet and we mean it not emotionally but in a very logical manner and you will understand why in Bharat well over thousands of years there has been a culture where people believed that the planetary positions impact people's lives here on earth now it's a matter of faith and personal belief so if you believe it just believe it and if someone else believes it and you don't just respect them for what they are if you're interested in my personal position we would rather believe in “manaeva manishanam karanam bandha mokshayu” that means we are alone responsible for the pleasure and pain that we experience in my life no one else and nothing else it's just me who is responsible now coming back to Jyotish shastra most of us are aware that in many temples across Bharat we find the Navagraha's being worshipped five planets and two lunar nodes and the sun and the moon total nine being worshipped in every temple now calculating the position of these Navagraha's has been of paramount importance in Bharat for various activities now how do you calculate it has always been done with respect to the background in which they are visible from the line of sight from earth that means you have constellations surrounding the planets and when you observe sun, moon, Saturn, Jupiter any of these planets from earth in which backdrop of the constellation that they are visible that's how people started measuring their positions and in fact predicting them as well if today a planet is visible in the backdrop of constellation x when would it come in the backdrop of constellation y so a very precise competition of time and planetary positions Jyotisha shastra is all about these two things and to achieve these trigonometry geometry calculus at least these are the three most important fields of mathematics that originated from Jyotisha shastra same way if we could dig deep into Yajurveda them this is where we could find the origins of the place value system or the Hindu number system that the whole world is using today. <br><br> 

 <img src="images/Bhartiya_Ganitam_1/Screenshot (90).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

In Shukla Yajurveda as part of worshiping Agni deva there are certain verses which quote powers of 10 as you can see here the essence of this sloka is that let the bricks surrounding this yagna Vedha grow exponentially in powers of ten and as part of it all these numbers of one ten hundred thousand ten thousand hundred thousand thousands of million hundred million and so on all these numbers are quoted so from Yajurveda them it is evidently visible that people back then were used to such high numbers practically or theoretically at the very least they are aware of such large numbers simplifying the cryptic roots from the Vedas. <br><br> 

<img src="images/Bhartiya_Ganitam_1/Screenshot (91).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

 It was Aryabhata who conceptualized and perfected this base 10 system what we are using today, and he is the one who unfortunately did not invent zero but rather he perfected the place value system and here is a sloka from his own writing the Aryabhatiya and the sloka goes like this, it is the position of a number which gives its value and this is what we have been using across the world today my main focus is not on the topic about the mathematics but it's about the mindset now if today if you say that let us start teaching our children about how the globally adopted Hindu number system originated from the Vedas one set of people will shout out secularism another set of people will shout out political agendas or freedom of religion or whatever nonsense and this is exactly the reason why we chose the word Ganapati to start explaining mathematics in Bharat mathematics and for that matter every field of education has been tightly coupled with the spiritual and philosophical facets of human life or in simple words Sanatana dharma <br><br>  

 <img src="images/Bhartiya_Ganitam_1/Screenshot (92).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

this base 10 positional value system or simply put the Hindu number system traveled westwards it was Severus sebokht in seventh century from Syria a Christian monk who introduced this number system to Syria for the first time and by extinction to the west Asia and then al-Khwarizmi in 8th century to Persia and Leonardo Pisano to Italy and by extinction to Europe 12th century and eventually with the European colonization the whole world adopted the Hindu number system. <br><br> 

<img src="images/Bhartiya_Ganitam_1/Screenshot (93).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

 and for those of you who are very interested in the subject read about this book written by Leonardo Pisano called Liberacki you know this man very well just that we used to call him Fibonacci and the Fibonacci series also originated from this book liberabacky was actually learned from Bharat and we are not saying that Leonardo Pisano himself wrote in his book that he learned it from the Indians the poster that you're seeing here towards your right is very interesting those were the times when Europe was using roman number system and abacus for their calculations and this is challenged by the Hindu number system introduced to Europe by Leonardo Pisano as you can see the abacus-based operations being challenged by the arithmetic operations based on the Hindu number system it's a very interesting history for those of you who are interested in the subject now again we would like to emphasize on the mindset now if you ask anyone about Indian contribution to mathematics 99 of the people will give this very sick answer saying that Indians invented zero which is fundamentally wrong zero is known to many civilizations and zero is not the contribution that came from Bharat it is the positional value system that has been perfected in Bharat that made calculations easy and that is the reason globally everybody adopted it if you want to really teach the history of this Hindu number system you should start teaching it from yes Yajur Vedam up until how it is got adopted around the world but any effort made in that direction some people believe that it is against their freedom of religion hell with the religion hell with the belief systems history has to be taught for its facts not for its narratives and propaganda <br><br> 

 <img src="images/Bhartiya_Ganitam_1/Screenshot (94).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

 and for this reason, we decided to start this series called Bhartiya Ganita to bring forward each speck of research and innovation that has gone into the field of mathematics from Bharat well over thousands of years panini and the long list of the great Indian mathematicians goes on and on and the contributions that came from Bharat applied geometry calculus trigonometry place value system negative numbers value of pi algebra indeterminate equations and again the list goes on and on so unlike my other documentary films where we go into very depth this doc film series we want to do it slightly different we want to cover each and every speck of research and innovation that has gone into the field of mathematics but in very short format we will try to keep it below 10 minutes because we have a huge backlog and we really want to bring forward to each and every one of you to enable you to do your own research people should at least be aware that world's oldest applied geometry is still active in Bharat today but 95 of us don't know it so such kind of things we want to put forward all the inputs that you could pick up for yourself and do your own research that is my objective with this web series the Bhartiya Ganita from project Bharat <br><br> 

 <img src="images/Bhartiya_Ganitam_1/Screenshot (95).png" style="height: 380px; border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>  

 and for one last time again we would like to reemphasize this topic the mindset you don't have to blindly believe or oppose anything in life and for that matter to be more specific Bhartiya Ganita and we would like to quote two great personalities albert einstein and maharishi Kanada einstein says we have no special talent we are only passionately curious it's about that critical thinking and inquisitive learning that will lead us to uncover the real knowledge not just from Bharat and for that matter any part of the world see every country is special in its own right for its history and heritage and so is Bharat when we am talking on behalf of Bharat with conviction we have no intention to undermine any other culture or a country and there is no intention to brag about any cultural supremacy that's absolute nonsense great contributions in the field of mathematics are for that matter any branch of science came in from world over it is just that the history of Bharat is not well known to many people and instead of learning what's the true knowledge people in this country Bharat were forced to learn about narratives and propaganda well that's called as a post-colonial hangover people know einstein but very few or rather many of us don't know who Maharshi Kanada is. Maharshi Kanada belonging to the period of around 200 BCE to 500 BCE he's the first one to conceptualize gravity and here is what Maharshi Kanada says the path to prosperity is led by Prayoga which means experiments which can be seen and experienced by oneself these are the words of the man who conceptualized gravity in his book called Vaisheshika Darshanam which is probably the oldest written record about gravity in the world let me quote the mindset here again the moment you hear about these things people either blindly beat their chest saying that Bharat is the only country who thrived in the field of science and technology during ancient times wrong every country has their own contributions and the second set of people call it as ultra nationalist far right Hindu propaganda even these guys are wrong because in first place they are deaf and blind so don't be like this left and right guys just be yourself have your mind eyes and ears all open towards what's right knowledge and speaking of the mindset again if you really want to understand how was ancient Indian education system back then and how do you reconcile these two spheres of science and religion and why science and dharma never work in conflict in Bharat while there has been conflicts between religion and science especially in Europe a very unbiased account watch this doc film it's streaming in the channel and we will try to leave the link below in the description so that's about it this is the first episode of this web series Bhartiya Ganita the most comprehensive web series on Bhartiya Ganita shastra and the most important problem that we need to deal with in first place is the mindset that we have do not blindly believe for or against anything that you hear because what we learn by and large has been polluted with political and religious propaganda and to understand what is the real knowledge you have to equip yourselves with critical thinking and inquisitive learning question each and every subject that you encounter what was the purpose of a concept in mathematics why it got originated where who when what are the proofs what are the ancient scriptures like this try to question each and every aspect of mathematics in our current context and only then by developing the critical thinking and inquisitive learning you will be able to understand what is the truth about Bhartiya Ganita and as always thanks for reading.
