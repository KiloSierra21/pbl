                - Concepts like latitudes, longitudes, and the prime meridian originated in Bharat.<br>
                - Lanka serves as a pivotal reference point for time and space calculations.<br>
                - The Hora system, dividing days based on planetary alignment, illustrates Bharat's understanding.<br>

if we take a look into the history of Bharat the profound understanding of space and time of bat is just incredible and undisputable the knowledge about computation of space and time that is emanated from bat is just unbelievable Raas the translation is the South Pole is referred as Rakshasa Alaya and the North Pole is referred as Devata Alaya why and what let's not get into that for the moment but the line that runs from rakshasa Alaya to Devata Alaya which is from south to North it passes through two important cities Avanti which is Ujjain and Rohitaka which is today's Rohitaka this essentially defines the prime meridian which is the basis for computation of a time in a day but what's important to look behind this concept is the origins of latitudes and longitudes the concept of mapping the entire globe with those imaginary lines what we are using today for our GPS it dates all the way back to Surya Siddhanta or maybe even before that now let me get this very straight I'm not saying that GPS was invented back then for God's sake all I'm saying is the concept of latitudes and longitudes the Antiquity of this scientific concept is far more older than what we could possibly imagine and that essentially translates to the profound understanding of Bhartia civilization on the concept of space and time as I said it's incredible and undisputable.<br><br>

 this essentially defines the prime meridian which is the basis for computation of a time in a day but what's important to look behind this concept is the origins of latitudes and longitudes the concept of mapping the entire globe with those imaginary lines what we are using today for our GPS it dates all the way back to Surya Siddhanta or maybe even before that now let me get this very straight I'm not saying that GPS was invented back then for God's sake all I'm saying is the concept of latitudes and longitudes the Antiquity of this scientific concept is far more older than what we could possibly imagine and that essentially translates to the profound understanding of Bhartia civilization on the concept of space and time as I said it's incredible and undisputable and once that vertically running prime meridian from North Pole to South Pole is defined based on that prime meridian Global space time calculations also emanated from Bharat and here is an example the translation of the Shloka is when the Sun rises in Lanka the sun sets in Siddhapura which is like the evening in Siddhapura and it's in the afternoon in Yamakoti and middle of the night in Romaka so basically what it says is Lanka we'll see what Lanka is for the moment hold it on but when it is early morning in Lanka the sun sets in Mexican region which is called as siddapura and it is afternoon in the regions of Australia and New Zealand today and middle of the night in Rome so this is probably one of the oldest day and night cycles precisely defined in Bharat by Varaha Mihira approximately in 495 ad that is 1500 years ago and to be precise 13th shloka 15th chapter Pancha Siddhanta written by Varaha Mihira and this precisely shows how profound the understanding of Bharat the concept of space and time this is just one example and there are many like this what's interesting here to observe is the names with which these places are called like the Australia and New Zealand region is called as Yamakoti the Mexican region or the southern part of the USA it's referred to as Siddhapura and Rome is absolutely not surprising it is called as Romaka because back then there was a lot of trade happening between Rome and bat and just to put this in a better perspective Varaha Mihira precisely defined the global positioning and the time as you just see here and a thousand years later people were still struggling to navigate to Bharata for its rich knowledge and wealth and speaking of Space-time there is one very important point on Earth that we all should be aware of that is Lanka now this is not Sri Lanka or Ravana Lanka not getting into that Lanka by definition means a land surrounded by water and it lies somewhere in the south of Bharata on the equator and if you remove all the water from the ocean this is how the ocean floor would look like and the rough location of Lanka is somewhere around this dotted line <br><br> 

 <img src="images/t and s images/Screenshot (15).png" style="height: 400px;"> <br><br> 

 because that's where the equator passes through horizontally so that is where Lanka is located now this Lanka is a central reference point to calculate space and time in Bharata why so what's the significance of this place it's pretty simple and straight this place is an intersection point of the prime meridian and equator and one more standing example about the ancient knowledge of Bharata and the concept of space and time is the definition of or rather the nomenclature of the days of a week <br><br> 

 <img src="images/t and s images/Screenshot (16).png" style="height: 400px;"> <br><br> 

 first the planets are sorted out in the order of increasing orbital velocity and that will give us Saturn the slowest to Moon the fastest Saturn Jupiter Mars Sun Venus Mercury moon no surprises here we're talking about the Nava Grahas or rather the Sapata Grahas because Rahu and Ketu are the shadow Paths of moon so we have seven physical or tangible planets so all these planets or grahams are sorted out in an increasing order of orbital velocity and like I already said in one of the earlier videos it's a 24-hour cycle one full day or one full earth rotation is divided into 24 parts and this 24 Parts it starts with the sunrise in Lanka at that point in time which graham is in line with sun that Mark start of that day and all the planets repeated for every 1 hour period and then comes the next planet in terms of its own orbital velocity so as you can see here the Saturday starts with Saturn in the line of Lanka and if you pass through all the 24-hour period then comes Sun itself in terms of orbital velocity in the line of lunker and the cycle goes on. <br><br>

 actually the 24 Hora system dividing one full earth rotation into 24 periods of 60 minutes each is called as a Hora and this is one way of dividing a day into equal parts there is another way of doing the same into 30 periods of 48 minutes each also called as mura so it's the Hora system which the whole world that we are using today in terms of our what's the origin of the word hour it is the Sanskrit word Hora so both are right ways of dividing a day into equal parts and the purposes are different Hora is more used for day-to-day activities and muhurta is used more for auspicious purposes nonetheless both are the same and here important to note what is Brahma muhurta it is a period of 48 minutes that starts 9 6 minutes before Sunrise why are we talking about this this is another example that demonstrates our understanding about space and time let me tell you why and how <br><br> 

 <img src="images/t and s images/Screenshot (18).png" style="height: 400px;"> <br><br> 

 in the southern part of Bharata there are five temples of Mahadev SRI Jambukeshwar, Kalahasteswara, Arunachaleshwara, Ekambareshwara and Chidambareshwar all these are present in Tamil Nadu and Andra Pradesh and all these five are revered as Pancha Bhuta lingams, Jambukeshwar representing water, Kalhasteswara representing air, Arunachaleshwara representing fire Ekambaresheshwar representing Earth and Chidambareshwar representing space. now all these five places or the Five Holy shrines are located on the 79° longitude while it sounds amusing that the temples spread over hundreds of kilometers apart from each other still vertically aligned with the longitude to a decent degree why or what is the reason let us try to understand <br><br> 

 <img src="images/t and s images/Screenshot (19).png" style="height: 400px;"> <br><br> 

 Ujjain Mahakaleswar is revered as the god of time and death and Ujjain stands in the same line as in Lanka hence Ujjain is taken as a reference point and whenever the Brahma Muhurtam starts in Ujjain that's when the Brahma Muhurtam is at its peak in this all five places of Pancha sthalam now this is just my observation I'm not making a sweeping statement but when I try to match the logic behind why these five panch sthalas are positioned geographically in reference to Ujjain because always remember Ujjain has been the central point of time computation in bharat for over thousands of years and this is yet another example of how space and time are intertwined and very well understood as well in Bharat <br><br> 

 <img src="images/t and s images/Screenshot (20).png" style="height: 400px;"> <br><br> 

 so that's a very brief outlook on the ancient knowledge of Bharat in the concept of space and time the prime meridian of Bharat once passed through Ujjain and it still does however the British by hook or crook they made the prime meridian pass through Greenwich to satisfy the imperialistic idiots because one important element that the current prime meridian misses out is the obliquity of Earth which is taken care in Bharat  passing through Ujjain and Lanka but is not taken care in the prime meridian that's a very deep discussion we'll try to summarize it in other video and also in one of the next upcoming videos we will see what is Jambu Dam quite a mythological place and also real as well let's try to understand Jambu Dam in one of the upcoming videos and for now this is all about the ancient knowledge of Bharat in space and time and as always thanks for reading.
