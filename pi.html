        1.Value of π in Katyayan Sulbha sutras (3700 BCE) 
        <br><br>
        The oldest reference of pi in ancient Indian history that is in yes or whether the approximations of pi as per ashram if we take the entire landscape of the Vedic knowledge system there are four Veda's that we all know and there are six Vedangas and there are four upavedas especially there is one branch of Vedanga called as Kalpa or Kalpa sutras which details out how the rituals need to be organized that were mentioned in years or with them especially yesterday and besides the theological aspects that are detailed out about how a Yagya needs to be organized there are a lot of geometrical principles also detailed out as part of the Kalpa sutras that is where our story starts so as part of these rituals which are mentioned in Yajurveda them how to practice them in day-to-day life so there are a lot of yagnas that needs to be organized and here what you're seeing in the picture is one such ritual which holds three fire altars or yagna Kunda with the names aha Agni in the square shape Dakshin Agni in a semi-circle and grahapatyagni in a circular shape and these are not some kind of random constructions they are to be aligned perfectly as per the principles of geometry defined in Kalpa sutras and that specific part of Kalpa sutras which deals with this geometrical principles are called as sulba sutrani and these are the set of geometrical principles or rather the world's oldest applied geometry that is still in practice today and coming back to these three fire altars which are in the shapes of square semicircle and circle a very important constraint to be followed was all three of them should be of exactly the same area this is one of the earliest scenarios where the ancient Vedic civilization people they encountered dealing with the areas of a circle and back then the area of a circle square or whichever geometric shape that we take their only equipment back then was nails and rope to take measurements of the shapes to execute this Vedic geometry and how to construct these three fire Altars there were detailed instructions rather algorithms that were given in Kalpa sutras how each geometric shape must be calculated on this topic I already made a separate doc film where I explained this algorithm step by step as to how the squaring of a circle and vice versa the problem that pestered mathematicians for thousands of years was solved in India back then. now let us stick only to pi as to how the value of pi was approximated so as part of these algorithms which were given to transform a circular fire altar to a square shape or a square shaped Fire altar to a circular one here is a relationship that was quoted: 
        <br><br>
        
         
        
        <img src="images/pi images/pi shloka yajurvedam.png" style="border-radius: 20px;"> 
        <br>
        <img src="images/pi images/pi yajurvedam 2.png" style="border-radius: 20px;"><br><br>
        
         
        
         
        
        a rope when stretched across the circle also goes three times around the circle <br><br> 
        
         
        
        which means that the ratio of a circumference to the diameter of a given circle is three divided by one which gives the value of pi as 3. <br><br>
        
         
        
        <img src="images/pi images/eq1pi.png"> <br><br>
        
         
        
        not very accurate as opposed to the actual value of pi of 3.1415 but considering their purpose back then and the fact that it was given thousands of years ago but that's how things evolve so that is one of the earliest valleys of pi that was found in India and of course the sulba sutrani gives few other values of pi as well extending to one or two other decimal places but essentially around three is the value that was proposed as part of silva sutrani not specifically calling it out as pi but just by quoting a relationship between the diameter and the circumference of a circle and here I am quoting the references from Katyayan and Sulbha Sutras and there are many other sulba sutras also which talk about this relationship which we call today as pi there is a lot of academic research also that has been done on Yajur Veda to understand the mathematical and the geometrical concepts that were detailed out and if you're interested you can do your own research so like i said what's very interesting is these mathematical principles that were given thousands of years ago are still being practiced in constructing this fire altars or yagna Kundam which are geometrically aligned with each other in terms of area so to sum it up all the approximation of pi in Vedas the purpose was to construct these circular shaped fire altars the proof was in sulba sutras the Boudhayan, Katyayan and Apastambha there are many other sulba sutras which detail out these mathematical concepts in construction of these fire altars and specially in Boudhayan and Katyayan Sulbha sutras the approximations of pi were given as I just quoted and coming to the precession the value of pi in some instances it is given as exactly 3 and in some instances it is given as 3.1 so that is a quick view about the Vedic approximations of pi and one very important thing here an indicative date that I've given here as 3700 BCE but theologically if you see the Vedas have a very long history so there cannot be a proper dating that could be done for the Vedas so a simpler and a more conservative and correct answer would be how old was Yajur Veda that old was these approximations of pi as part of Yajur Veda 
        <br><br>
        
        2.Value of pi by Aryabhatta(6th century):
        <br><br>
        <img src="images/pi images/aryabhatta.jpg" style="height: 300px;border-radius: 20px;">
        <br><br>
        so now moving to the next milestone that happened in 6th century Aryabhatta he gave the approximations of pi so let's try to understand that Aryabhatta is part of Aryabhattiyam the astronomical treaties that he wrote he gave a numerical approximation for pi directly this is what he quoted: 
        <br><br>
        <img src="images/pi images/pi by aryabhatta 3.png" style="border-radius: 20px;"> 
        <br><br>
         hundred added four multiplied by eight and added sixty-two thousand this is the circumference of a circle whose diameter is twenty thousand. 
         <br><br>
         
        
         <img src="images/pi images/eq2pi.png"> 

        <br><br>
        
        so that gives us a fraction of 62,832 divided by 20,000 and that gives a value of pi as 3.1416 as opposed to the accurate value of pi as 3.14159 and so on and he says that this value is an approximate figure and also like I said pi is the name given by the Greeks to call this constant with a name but in ancient Indian scriptures if you see it is always given as a relationship between diameter and the circumference of a given circle which of course translates to the pi what we use today and very interestingly Aryabhatta also gave a formula to calculate the area of a circle without using the value of pi and here it is half of the circumference multiplied by the radius of a given circle essentially gives the area of that circle and like I said in ancient India geometry was executed using ropes and nails so figuring out the circumference of a circle with a rope and its radius it's pretty doable and here is where the geometry that originated in Europe which is heavily based on compass and scale it had certain limitations the flexibility that a rope offers in geometrical calculations it's far better than the flexibility that a compass offers but anyways that's just a minor observation so let's get back to this one so the purpose of pi given by Aryabhatta is to employ it in the astronomical and geometrical calculations which belongs to the larger corpus of Jyotish shastra especially out of Ujjain .Ujjain was a powerhouse of mathematics and time competition and astronomy geometry and a lot more back then and coming to the proof the scripture in which this value was detailed out coming to the precession it is 3.1416 as opposed to the actual value of 3.14159 
        <br><br>
        3.Series of π by Madhava (14th century) 
        <br><br>
        <img src="images/pi images/madhava.webp" style="border-radius: 20px;">
        <br><br>
         Moving next to the 16th century milestone this is the game-changing invention that came in from India an approximation of pi given by Madhava one of the earliest methods of calculating the value of pi was given by Archimedes through the method of exhaustion so basically what it means is so what is pi it is the ratio of circumference to the diameter of a given circle right now what if we calculate the value of pi for a square instead of a circle that is the circumference of a square divided by its diameter but square does not have a diameter so what is it is it a side or a diagonal or an average of both so with this thought process Archimedes embarked on a method of exhaustion which is to calculate the ratios of circumference to the diagonals of polygons extended one side at a time because Archimedes had a very interesting perspective that a circle is nothing but a polygon which has n number of sides where n could be a very large number if you try to analyze the thought process of Archimedes it exactly matches with the thought process of Madhav Acharya who in the year 1300s came up with a similar kind of an approximation of pi but only the difference is Archimedes was doing it geometrically while Madhava tried to do it in an arithmetic manner so let's try and understand what is that Madhava gave the value of pi as: 
         
        <br><br>
          <img src="images/pi images/eq3pi.png">
         <br><br>
         4 multiplied with an alternating series of 1 minus 1 by 3 plus 1 by 5 minus 1 by 7 plus 1 by 9 and so on and this formula for pi is given in this small Sanskrit shloka which elaborates to the infinite series of the value of pi the infinite series what it means is you can calculate the value of pi depending on the number of digits that you incorporate into your equation longer the number of terms that we considered in the series accurate the value of pi would be and this was revolutionary because till then for thousands of years civilizations have been adding one digit after another perfecting the value of pi but there was no generalized formula for pi which can give you a number of digits as per your need and Madhava invented just that and not just that this is also the first instance in the history of mankind where a finite quantity of pi could be expressed as a sum of an infinite series laying the stepping stone for calculus integration by parts and this was 350 years before newton conceived his version of calculus Madhava and his inventions in the field of calculus or be the infinite series of pi and many other contributions that came in from him they are very well popular in the academic circles but not so much in the general public in fact the Homi Bhabha center for science education and tata institute of fundamental research they organize a competition called as Madhava's mathematics competition in the honor of this great mathematician who invented the infinite series of pile and many more including the foundations of calculus which was first invented in Bharata the purpose for which Madhava invented the infinite series of pai was to devise calculus as an instrument for astronomical calculations as part of Jyotish shastra he's an astronomer and mathematician based out of Kerala and especially in astronomical calculations it is very important to have more precise value of pi as per your need in fact Madhava was one of the first astronomers to accurately calculate the position of moon for every 36 minutes so there are a lot of great things about Madhava but coming back here so that is the purpose and coming to the proof he detailed out this infinite series of pi in Maha jnana in a Prakarana but treaties on calculations of science co-science tangents etc. with infinite series coming to the procession of pi given by Madhava as I said it's an infinite series but nonetheless it takes incredible amount of effort to calculate using this infinite series but yes the precession can be obtained depending on your patience but it precisely gives the value of pi following the formula given by Madhava.

        4.Fastest calculation of pi by Ramanujan (20th century): 
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        we can't really call the 20th century as ancient India but if we don't talk about this contribution that came in from Srinivasa Ramanujan about the value of pi this video will be grossly incomplete Ramanujan was the one who proposed the fastest calculation for the value of pi while Madhava's infinite series for the value of pi is very doable but it takes incredible amount of effort to refine the value of pi to more and more decimal places you have to incorporate thousands of terms into that infinite series to get the value of pi to few tens of decimal places Srinivasa Ramanujan came with his own formula for pi what you're seeing here: 
        <br><br>

        = 3.1415926535 8979323846264338327950288419716939937510 58209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679.... 
        <br><br>
         
        
         sounds to be very complex and weird but this formula of pi is the fastest one of those times to calculate the pi in matter of minutes and there are tons of other examples that he scribbled in his notebook as to how to reach to the value of pi quickly and of course precisely is one of the very few mathematicians who gave the fastest convergence for the value of pi and even today these formulas given by Ramanujan form the bedrock for calculations of the values of pi and many other concepts around it so that is a complete outlook about how pi has evolved over thousands of years in India there are many other mathematicians and astronomers who worked on this transcendental number pi but we just took these four as they are relatively more significant than other contributions that came in from Bharat refining the value of pi so the earliest approximations for the value of pi from Yajur Vedam which is given around 3 is well known for its antiquity one of the oldest references of pi not just in Bharat but around the world but there are also other civilizations who calculated pi more accurately than what was given in Yajur Vedam and that's very important to note nonetheless the antiquity of this particular approximation really stands out moving next to aryabhatta his value of 3.1416 is very handy but at the same time and during the same period in China a better approximation was proposed and moving next to Madhava this one definitely is a groundbreaking revolution that came from India where there was a full stop to adding one digit after other to the decimal places rather calculating the value of pi to an infinite series so it was an unprecedented accuracy and then coming to Srinivasa Ramanujan his formula gave an unprecedented speed to the calculations of pi the contributions that came in from India in refining the value of pi are just incredible and these historical milestones with their purpose proof and precession the history speaks for itself and this is the story of the evolution of pi in India which is wide deep and rich than a simple 22/7 and as always thanks for reading.
